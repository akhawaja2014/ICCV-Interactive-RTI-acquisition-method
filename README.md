# Interactive-RTI-acquisition-method
We have investigated the problem of optimized acquisition
for RTI in 2D ring setup in this paper. We have
proposed a methodology based on signal analysis which
is computationally very cheap. The average computational
time for proposing new light positions is 0.48 seconds on
MATLAB using 11 Gen Intel Core i7 cpu. This marks a
notable reduction in comparison to existing algorithms, signaling
a promising avenue for further exploration. Our algorithm
can effectively address surfaces with both linear and
significantly non-linear reflectance profiles.

## Implementation
The code is written in MATLAB and a GUI is made to test the algorithm.
